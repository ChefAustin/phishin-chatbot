The Phish.in' Chatbot is another way to interact with the [Phish.in' API](https://phish.in/api-docs), which is also an [open source project](https://github.com/jcraigk/phishin).

The production instance of this chatbot is hosted at [https://chatbot.phish.in](chatbot.phish.in), which will eventually provide a means of integrating with your team's Slack or Discord.
